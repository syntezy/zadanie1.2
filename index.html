                <span>[Verse 1: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                Fireflies, a million little pieces
                Feeds the dying light, and breathes me back to life
                In your eyes, I see something to believe in
                Your hands are like a flame
                Your palms the sweetest pain
                <br><br>
                <span>[Verse 1: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                Let the darkness lead us into the light
                Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
                Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                Like a starship speeding into the night
                You and I get lost in the infinite lights
                Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                <br><br>
                <span>[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite
            </p>
            <p class="verse-2">
                <span>[Verse 2: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                So alive, your touch is like the daylight
                Burning on my skin, it turns me on again
                You and I, survivors of the same kind
                And we're the only ones
                Dancing on the sun
                <br><br>
                <span>[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                Let the darkness lead us into the light
                Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
                Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                Like a starship speeding into the night
                You and I get lost in the infinite lights
                Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                <br><br>
                <span>[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite

                <span>[Bridge: Seungri]</span><br>
                Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
                We're monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
                Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
                Hear you calling for me
                Hear you calling me on from afar
                <br><br>
                <span>[Chorus 2: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                Let the darkness lead us into the light
                Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
                Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                I feel the heat as we collide
                Like a fever that feels so right
                So baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
                One touch and I ignite
                <br><br>
                <span>[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]</span><br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite<br>
                One touch and I ignite
